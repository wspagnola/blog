## Avoiding Flame Wars

Before my life as a statistician/data analyst, I was a special education teacher in the Bronx with an undergraduate degree in English with a Spanish minor.  At the time, I viewed the worlds of math and science as free from the subjective/emotional debates waged within the liberal arts.  Little did I know, that turf wars seem to be endemic to all fields.  During my graduate statistics, I even discovered that there were intense disagreements about the fundamental nature of probability.

I have to admit that I enjoy observing these online discussions.  However, as with many things on the internet, these discussions sometimes devolve into very personal debates.  I look forward to exploring different philosophical ideas within statistics and data science on this blog, but on certain topics, I  would prefer to be an observer rather than a participant. To that end, I've compiled  a list of six statistics/data science topics that tend to stoke conflict on social media.


## List of  Minefields to Avoid 

1. Bayesian vs. Frequentist Statistics
2. Linear vs. Logistic Regression for Binary Outcomes
3. R vs. Python
4. DAGS/SCM vs. Potential Outcomes for Causal Inference 
5. Poisson Regression with Quasi-MLE vs. Negative Binomial Regression for Count Data
6. Survey Weighting vs. Multi-level Regression with Post-Stratification for Survey Data

This list is by no means exhaustive, and I may add more topics later.  

Let me know if you've noticed any statistical topics that seem to provoke emotions online.
