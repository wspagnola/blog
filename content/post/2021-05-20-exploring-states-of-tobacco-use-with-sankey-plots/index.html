<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>While working toward my master’s degree in applied statistics, I interned at the <a href="https://publichealth.nyu.edu/research-scholarship/centers-labs-initiatives/tobacco-research-lab">Tobacco Research Lab</a> at NYU’s College of Global Public Health. During my internship, I collaborated with another researcher to study changing smoking states over time. We were interested in answering questions such as what proportion of cigarette smokers quit and what proportion of former smokers relapse.</p>
<p>We began our project by focusing on descriptive statistics and data visualization. To represent changes in smoking behavior over time, we used a data visualization technique called a Sankey diagram. I will be mainly focusing on Sankey diagrams in this post; however, I will also provide some background on the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study.</p>
</div>
<div id="required-r-skills" class="section level1">
<h1>Required R Skills</h1>
<p>Preparing the data required some data manipulation. I used a few basic tidyverse functions to accomplish this. You can find many online tutorials on R and the tidyverse.</p>
</div>
<div id="about-the-path-study-and-data" class="section level1">
<h1>About the PATH Study and Data</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://pathstudyinfo.nih.gov/">PATH study</a> is a longitudinal study of tobacco use and attitudes funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administation (FDA). The study began in 2013 and has aimed to follow the same respondents across multiple waves. The fourth and most recent wave ended in January of 2018. According to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/research/fda-and-nih-study-population-assessment-tobacco-and-health">FDA’s website</a>, one of the study’s goals is to explore “patterns of tobacco product use, cessation, and relapse”, which aligned well with the focus of my internship.</p>
</div>
<div id="states-of-tobacco-use" class="section level1">
<h1>States of Tobacco Use</h1>
<p>The PATH survey offers a number of ways to classify smokers. For my internship, we focused on five states of cigarette smoking/cessation.</p>
<div id="smoking-behavior-classifications" class="section level4">
<h4>Smoking Behavior Classifications</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Current Established Smoker</li>
<li>Former Established Smoker</li>
<li>Current Experimental Smoker</li>
<li>Former Experimental Smoker</li>
<li>Never Smoker</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>never smoker</strong> category is self-explanatory, but the other ones may require some clarification.</p>
</div>
<div id="established-vs.-experimental-smokers" class="section level4">
<h4>Established vs. Experimental Smokers</h4>
<p>Established smokers were classified as respondents who reported to have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Experimental smokers were those who reported smoking between 1 and 99 cigarettes in their lifetime.</p>
</div>
<div id="current-vs.-former-smokers" class="section level4">
<h4>Current vs. Former Smokers</h4>
<p>Current smokers were those who reported currently smoking everyday or some days. Former smokers were those who had reported smoking at least one cigarette in their lifetime but were not smoking currently.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="our-objective" class="section level1">
<h1>Our Objective</h1>
<p>Our first objective was to create a Sankey Diagram to visualize these transitions across the three waves of data that were available at the time my internship.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-sankey-diagrams" class="section level1">
<h1>A Brief History of Sankey Diagrams</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram#:~:text=Sankey%20diagrams%20are%20a%20type,proportional%20to%20the%20flow%20rate.&amp;text=Sankey%20diagrams%20emphasize%20the%20major,quantities%20within%20defined%20system%20boundaries">Sankey diagrams</a> are a type of flow chart to model transitions over time. In a Sankey diagram, the proportions of each flow are represented through the width of the arrows.</p>
<p>Sankey diagrams are named after Captain Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram</a>, an Irish engineer, who created a diagram of the flow of steam through an engine in 1898. Below is the Steam Engine diagram he created.</p>

<p>Another famous example was created by Charles Minard almost 30 years earlier. Minard’s diagram shows the movement of Napoleon’s army during his 1812 Russian campaign. In the visualization, the width of the arrow becomes thinner as casualties and desertions diminishes the size of Napoleon’s army.</p>

<div id="getting-the-data-in-shape" class="section level1">
<h1>Getting the Data in Shape</h1>
<p>To create our own Sankey diagram, we decided to use <a href="https://flourish.studio/">Flourish Studio</a>. Flourish offers a variety of visualizations including three types of Sankey diagrams. We chose the multi-step alluvial Sankey diagram because each flow is measured at the same time points, i.e. each wave of the survey.</p>
<p>Before uploading our dataset, we needed to structure it to fit Flourish’s specifications. This is where R comes in handy. The Sankey Diagram dataset should have the following five columns.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Column A:</strong> The <em>Source</em> of the flow
</li>
<li>
<strong>Column B:</strong> The <em>Target</em> of the flow
</li>
<li>
<strong>Column C:</strong> The <em>Value</em> of each flow, i.e. the number or proportion of units flowing from the source to the target at a given point in time
</li>
<li>
<strong>Column D:</strong> The <em>Step From</em> column, which indicates the time point of the Source Column
</li>
<li>
<strong>Column E:</strong> The <em>Step To</em> column, which indicates the time point of the Target column
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example of how the data should be structured.</p>
<div id="htmlwidget-1" style="width:100%;height:480px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1">{"x":{"url":"index_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-5.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Each row in the dataset represents a unique flow or arrow between two waves of the study. For example, in the above table, there were 3,000 <strong>Never Smokers</strong> in <strong>Wave 1</strong> (Rows 1 and 2). Of these 3,000 <strong>Never Smokers</strong>, 2,000 remained <strong>Never Smokers</strong> and 1,000 became <strong>Current Established Smokers</strong> in <strong>Wave 2</strong>. Starting in <strong>Wave 2</strong>, there were 2,200 <strong>Current Established Smokers</strong> (Rows 7 and 8). Of these respondents, 1,800 remained <strong>Current Established Smokers</strong> and 400 became <strong>Former Smokers</strong> in <strong>Wave 3</strong>.</p>
<div id="constructing-and-loading-path-dathset" class="section level3">
<h3>Constructing and Loading PATH Dathset</h3>
<p>So now it’s time to go back to our path data. I constructed the <strong>adult_panel</strong> csv file by merging together the first three waves of the study <em>(Note: The fourth wave of the study was not available during the time of my internship)</em>. I also constructed a smoking status variable for each wave based on our five smoking behavior classifications.</p>
<p>I loaded this dataset into R. I only kept three variables: PERSONID , which is the unique ID of each respondent, and the three smoking category variables (one for each wave).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dta_raw &lt;- read.csv(&quot;../../../data/adult_panel.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = TRUE) 

dta &lt;- dta_raw %&gt;% 
  dplyr::select(PERSONID, starts_with(&#39;smoking_status_full&#39;)) %&gt;% 
  tidyr::drop_na() 

glimpse(dta)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 21,400
## Columns: 4
## $ PERSONID               &lt;fct&gt; P000000004, P000000005, P000000030, P000000074,…

## $ smoking_status_full_w2 &lt;fct&gt; never_smoker, current_exp_smoker, current_exp_s…
## $ smoking_status_full_w3 &lt;fct&gt; never_smoker, current_exp_smoker, current_est_s…</code></pre>
<div id="note-on-survey-weights" class="section level4">
<h4>Note on Survey Weights</h4>
<p>I also only kept complete cases, i.e. adults who participated in all of the first three waves of the study. I did this for simplicity. However, it’s important to note that to make valid inferences to the general population, we would need to adjust these numbers using survey weights. These survey weights are available in the original files. These survey weights would also allow us to adjust for item non-response and attrition. In the future, I plan to create another diagram that adjusts each flow by the survey weights. In the meantime, using raw counts will help give us a rough estimate of smoking transition over time and allow us to demonstrate the steps needed to construct a Sankey Diagram on Flourish Studio. I’ve included a brief explanation of the <a href="#survey_weights">Survey Weighting</a> process at the end of this post.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="transposing-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Transposing Data</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve loaded the data into R, we need to transpose the dataset into a “long” format. Each row now represents a respondent’s smoking status in a particular wave. We can use the pivot_longer() from the tidyverse library. By setting the cols parameter to “- PERSONID”, we can pivot all the columns to a long format except the PERSONID column. Now the <em>name</em> column represents the original variable name and the value represents the status for each smoker PERSONID during the wave indicated in the <em>name</em> column.For example, the first three columns represent the smoking status of respondent “P000000004” across the first three waves of the study. We can observe that this individual reported being a “never smoker” during the first three waves of the study.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dta_long &lt;- dta %&gt;%  
              tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = - PERSONID) 
dta_long %&gt;%  head</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   PERSONID   name                   value             
##   &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;fct&gt;             
## 1 P000000004 smoking_status_full_w1 never_smoker      
## 2 P000000004 smoking_status_full_w2 never_smoker      
## 3 P000000004 smoking_status_full_w3 never_smoker      
## 4 P000000005 smoking_status_full_w1 current_exp_smoker
## 5 P000000005 smoking_status_full_w2 current_exp_smoker
## 6 P000000005 smoking_status_full_w3 current_exp_smoker</code></pre>
<p>Next we need to convert the “name” column into an integer. I used the string subset command from the stringr to extract the wave number from the “name” column. We can then drop the original name column.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dta_long &lt;- dta_long %&gt;% 
              dplyr::mutate(wave = as.integer(str_sub(name, -1))) %&gt;% 
              dplyr::select(-name)

dta_long %&gt;%  head</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 3

<div id="source-data-subset" class="section level4">
<h4>Source Data Subset</h4>
<p>The next step is to create two separate datasets: one for the source data and one for the target data. We can create the source dataset by dropping the latest wave. We then rename the value variable to “source” and the wave variable to “step_from”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#drop the last wave
dta_source &lt;- dta_long %&gt;% 
                dplyr::filter(wave != max(wave)) %&gt;% 
                rename(source = value,
                       step_from = wave)
dta_source %&gt;%  head</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 3

## 2 P000000004 never_smoker               2

<p>The rows in this dataset represent the starting point of each flow. Consequently, we exclude the latest wave, which at the time of my internship was wave 3.</p>
</div>
<div id="target-dataset" class="section level4">
<h4>Target Dataset</h4>
<p>Next I created a “Target” dataset, which i the endpoint of each flow. We can create this dataset by dropping the first wave from the dataset. I renamed the value column to “target” and the wave column to “step_to”, which respectively represent the value and time at the end of each flow. I also renamed the PERSONID column to avoid duplication.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Drop first wave

              dplyr::filter(wave != 1) %&gt;%

<h3>Grouping and Summarizing the Data</h3>
<p>The last step before uploading our dataset is to aggregate the data. The final dataset will not be on the individual-level but should represent each flow in the dataset. We can accomplish this using the group_by() and summarize() functions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dta_sankey_cnt &lt;-dta_sankey %&gt;%

<p>There are 34 rows in our new dataset. Each row represents a transition between two smoking states across two consequent waves. The number in the value column indicates the number of respondents in each flow. For example, there were 889 respondents who went from being “current established smokers” to “former established smokers” from wave 1 to wave 2 (indicated by the step_to and step_from columns).</p>

<h1>Using our Sankey Diagram to Explore Cigarette Smoking Patterns over Time</h1>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that the thickest line from each state flows the same state in the next wave. Your most likely state in the next wave of the study is your state in the current wave of the study.</p>
<p>Another thing that I noticed was that the “never smokers” flow seemed to be the most stable. Never smokers in Wave 1 tended to stay never-smokers in Waves 2 and 3. This stability is likely to due to the fact that all the respondents were over the age of 18 during the first wave of the study. Adults who are never smokers do not tend to take up smoking later in life. For this reason, it would also be interesting to explore the Youth survey to investigate how respondents under the age of 18 started to experiment with cigarette smokers.</p>
<p>We were also interested in exploring relapse rates among former established smokers over time. From Wave 1 to Wave 2 about 12% (432 out 3,607) of former established smokers relapsed. About the same proportion (12.4% or 521 out of 4,437 to be exact) relapsed between Waves 2 and 3.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Creating a Sankey Diagram is a great way to explore transitions over time. For example, upon viewing the Sankey diagram, it becomes clear that the never smokers category is remarkably stable over time. I look forward to create ore Sankey diagrams to explore other longitudinal datasets.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a few additional ideas of things to do with the PATH data. Some of these would be building on the work that I already did during my internship and other ones would be charting new territory.</p>

<h2>Original Datasets</h2>
<p>You can download the public-use datasets <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NAHDAP/studies/36498">here</a>.</p>
<p>The files DS1001, DS2001, DS3001, and DS4001 correspond to waves 1 through 4 of the adult survey.</p>
<p>Once you download these datasets you can merge them by the variable PERSONID. This creates a “wide” dataset in which each column contained a particular variable from a single wave. In my <em>adult_panel</em> dataset, I added a suffixes (w1, w2, w3) indicating which wave each variable comes from.The original variable names include the prefix R01, R02, R03, and R04 where “R” refers to the adult survey and the numbers refer to the particular wave.</p>
<div id="original-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Original Variables</h3>
<p>The dataset includes the original questions used to derive each smoking category as well as series of derived indicator variables for each category.
1. R01R_A_CUR_ESTD_CIGS: Wave 1 Current Established Smokers
2. R01R_A_CUR_EXPR_CIGS: Wave 1 Current Experimental Smokers
3. R01R_A_FMR_ESTD_CIGS: Wave 1 Former Established Smokers
4. R01R_A_FMR_EXPR_CIGS: Wave 1 Former Experimental Smokers</p>
<p>The variables in the other datasets have the same name with the number after the initial “R” representing the wave of the study. The only other differncee is that the wave 2 and wave 3 “former” smoker categories have a "_REV" suffix, e.g. R02R_A_FMR_ESTD_CIGS_REV represents wave 2 former established smokers.</p>
<p>To find wave 1 never smokers, you can use the variable R01R_A_NVR_CIGS. To find never smokers in waves 2 and 3, you can use the completment of R02R_A_EVR_CIGS and R03R_A_EVR_CIGS.</p>
<p>The dataset also includes indicators for whether a person was “continuing adult” in a given wave of the study. However, we can use a inner join to constrain our sample to include only adults from wave 1 who responded in each subsequent wave.</p>
</div>
<div id="survey_weights" class="section level3">
<h3>Survey Weighting</h3>
<p>The survey actually has a series of weights to adjust for both attrition and non-representativeness of the sample. The weights take into account several factors.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Complex sampling design:</strong> As in most surveys, the PATH study used both stratification and clustering sampling methods instead of simple random sampling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intentional Oversampling:</strong> The PATH survey intentionally over samples people between the ages of 18 and 34 as well as African-American adults.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-response bias:</strong> The characteristics of respondents may not reflect the population because not everyone</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attrition:</strong> Some respondents end up dropping out of the study after participating in the first wave.</p></li>

<h2>Multi-state Modeling</h2>
<p>Multi-state modeling is a good tool for estimating the probability of transitioning<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/vignettes/compete.pdf%5D">Therneau, Crowson, &amp; Atkinson, 2021</a>. Multi-state modeling is essentially a generalization of survival analysis (ibid). In survival analysis there only two stages, life and death, and you can only transition from the first state to the second. However, in multi-state modeling there can be more than two states and it can be possible to revert. For example, if we focus cigarette smoking, we can imagine the five states that we used for our Sankey diagram. In this model, it would be possible to transition back and forth between some states such as between current established smoker and former established smoker. The major assumption is that the the</p>

## Current Smoker &quot;p11&quot;          &quot;p21&quot;         &quot;0&quot;         
## Former Smoker  &quot;p12&quot;          &quot;p22&quot;         &quot;0&quot;

<p>The row names represent the state in a wave (<em>t</em>) and the column names represent the state in the next wave (<em>t+1</em>). I’ve removed the established vs. experimental distinction in order to simplify the matrix. Each element within represents the probability of transitioning from one state to the next between two waves of the study. For example, p21 represents the probability of a current smoker becoming a former smoker from time <em>t</em> to time <em>t + 1</em>. Notice that the first two rows in the third column are equal to zero because current and former smokers cannot become never smokers again.</p>
<p>Although this example would be an example of discrete-time, multi-state models can also be used in continuous cases. Also the most common assumptions is these models are that transition probabilities only depend on the current state <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2692556/#:~:text=The%20analysis%20in%20such%20studies,a%20finite%20number%20of%20states.&amp;text=A%20change%20of%20state%20is%20called%20a%20transition%2C%20or%20an%20event">Meira-Machado et. al, 2009</a>.</p>
