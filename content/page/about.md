## About

Hello, my name is William (also Bill) Spagnola, and I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of data science and social science research. I enjoy using statistics/data analysis to solve real-world problems. 

## Organization

I'm currently working for the Research Alliance for New York City Schools.  My current projects include implementing a regression discontinuity design to identify the impact of Career Technical Education (CTE) on the graduation outcomes NYC high school students and developing a survey to evaluate the benefits of an after-school program designed to increase STEM awareness/engagement among disadvantaged students.
