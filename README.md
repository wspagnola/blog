# Data Science Statistics Blog

I'm using blogdown package and netlify to create a statistics/data science/programming blog.  I've decided to use the ghostwriter theme in Hugo. 


# Common Blogdown Functions
1. **blogdown::new_post(title)**: Create a new blog post
2. **blogdown::serve_site()**: Runs the site locally.  This way you can observe how your website looks within RStudio. 
3. **blogdown::stop_server()**: Stops the local web server
