      <description>Avoiding Flame Wars Before my life as a statistician/data analyst, I was a special education teacher in the Bronx with an undergraduate degree in English with a Spanish minor. At the time, I viewed the worlds of math and science as free from the subjective/emotional debates waged within the liberal arts. Little did I know, that turf wars seem to be endemic to all fields.

      <description>This is my first attempt at starting a statistics/data science blog. I hope to work on the following topics:
Potential List of Blog Topics  Statistics/Causal Inference through simulation My learning process as I explore new packages, programming functions Descriptions of the data analysis/machine learning projects in my Github Repo Interesting statistics papers as well as statistical topics trending on social media Tutorials of basic programming, statistical/machine learning concepts  My hope is that as I continue to write, I&amp;rsquo;ll get a better idea of which topics I would like to focus on.</description>

      <description>About Hello, my name is William (also Bill) Spagnola, and I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about exploring the intersection of data science and social science research. I enjoy using statistics/data analysis to solve real-world problems.
Organization I&amp;rsquo;m currently working for the Research Alliance for New York City Schools. My current projects include implementing a regression discontinuity design to identify the impact of Career Technical Education (CTE) on the graduation outcomes NYC high school students and developing a survey to evaluate the benefits of an after-school program designed to increase STEM awareness/engagement among disadvantaged students.</description>
