      <description>Introduction While working toward my master’s degree in applied statistics, I interned at the Tobacco Research Lab at NYU’s College of Global Public Health. During my internship, I collaborated with another researcher
 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Survey The PATH study is a longitudinal study of tobacco use and attitudes funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administation (FDA). The study began in 2013 and has aimed to follow the same respondents across multiple waves.</description>

      <description>Introduction As a former teacher, I’m often intrigued by the way in which education issues provoke such strong feelings among non-educators. Teacher unions tend to elicit particularly strong opinions.
Since so many people have strong opinions about unions, I decided to perform a state-level exploratory analysis of the relationship between test scores and unionization rates.
 Standard Correlation vs. Causation Caveat Of course, I need to start with the caveat that these data are purely correlational.</description>

      <description>Avoiding Flame Wars Before my life as a statistician/data analyst, I was a special education teacher in the Bronx with an undergraduate degree in English with a Spanish minor. At the time, I viewed the worlds of math and science as free from the subjective/emotional debates waged within the liberal arts. Little did I know, that turf wars seem to be endemic to all fields. During my graduate studies in statistics, I discovered that there were even intense disagreements about the fundamental nature of probability.</description>

      <description>This is my first attempt at starting a statistics/data science blog. I hope to work on the following topics:
Potential List of Blog Topics  Statistics/Causal Inference through simulation My learning process as I explore new packages, programming functions Descriptions of the data analysis/machine learning projects in my Github Repo Interesting statistics papers as well as statistical topics trending on social media Tutorials of basic programming, statistical/machine learning concepts  My hope is that as I continue to write, I&amp;rsquo;ll get a better idea of which topics I would like to focus on.</description>
