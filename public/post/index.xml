      <description>Introduction As a former teacher, I’m often intrigued by the way in which education issues provoke such strong feelings among non-educators. Teacher unions tend to elicit particularly strong opinions.
Since so many people have strong opinions about unions, I decided to perform a state-level exploratory analysis of the relationship between test scores and unionization rates.

      <description>Avoiding Flame Wars Before my life as a statistician/data analyst, I was a special education teacher in the Bronx with an undergraduate degree in English with a Spanish minor. At the time, I viewed the worlds of math and science as free from the subjective/emotional debates waged within the liberal arts. Little did I know, that turf wars seem to be endemic to all fields. During my graduate studies in statistics, I discovered that there were even intense disagreements about the fundamental nature of probability.</description>

      <description>This is my first attempt at starting a statistics/data science blog. I hope to work on the following topics:
Potential List of Blog Topics  Statistics/Causal Inference through simulation My learning process as I explore new packages, programming functions Descriptions of the data analysis/machine learning projects in my Github Repo Interesting statistics papers as well as statistical topics trending on social media Tutorials of basic programming, statistical/machine learning concepts  My hope is that as I continue to write, I&amp;rsquo;ll get a better idea of which topics I would like to focus on.</description>
